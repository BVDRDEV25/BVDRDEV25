Hello! I am Badr Ahmed Soliman, a 15-year-old frontend programmer from Egypt. I use GitHub to host my code,
collaborate on projects,
and manage version control. GitHub allows me to keep track of changes in my projects,
work with other developers, and showcase my work to the world. It's an essential tool for any programmer,
especially in frontend development,
where collaboration and version control are key to success.
